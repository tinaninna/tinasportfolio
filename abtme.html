    <p style="padding:0 20% ; font-size: 1.1rem;" >I'm Tinebeb Amsalu, a Software Engineering student at ASTU, currently in my final year of study. I have a strong academic foundation in software development and programming, and I’ve complemented that knowledge with real-world experience through a 2-month internship focused on front-end development. During that time, I worked on designing and implementing responsive, user-friendly interfaces using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This practical exposure taught me the importance of not just writing clean code, but also creating layouts that are accessible, visually consistent, and easy to navigate across different devices.</p>
    <p style="padding:0 20% ; font-size: 1.1rem;" >Over time, my curiosity about how technology can solve real-world problems has led me toward data science. I find it exciting how meaningful insights can be extracted from data to support better decision-making, improve systems, and optimize processes. I'm currently learning the fundamentals of data science with Python, focusing on libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, and I look forward to applying these skills in future projects. I’m especially interested in the intersection of development and data — where interactive user experiences meet intelligent back-end logic powered by data insights.</p>
    <p style="padding:0 20% ; font-size: 1.1rem;" >What drives me is the process of building systems that are both practical and impactful. Whether it’s a clean user interface or a well-structured data analysis pipeline, I enjoy the creative and problem-solving aspects of engineering. I value continuous learning and actively seek opportunities to grow — through online courses, collaborative projects, or hands-on experimentation. I'm also working on strengthening my soft skills, such as communication, time management, and teamwork, which I believe are just as critical in professional environments.</p>
    <p style="padding:0 20% ; font-size: 1.1rem;">Looking ahead, my goal is to continue developing as a well-rounded tech professional who can contribute to both the front-end and data-driven sides of software. I aim to build solutions that are not only technically sound but also meaningful and user-focused — systems that solve problems and add real value to people’s lives.</p>
